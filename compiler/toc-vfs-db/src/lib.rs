//! Interface layer for the database that abstracts over the native file system.
//!
//! Paths are interned into [`RawPath`](toc_paths::RawPath) entities, which are
//! in `toc-paths` so that other crates can just depend on `toc-paths` and not
//! have to depend on the entirety of `toc-vfs-db`.
//!
//! Paths that correspond to source files are represented by [`SourceFile`]
//! inputs. [`source_of()`] is used to lookup the corresponding [`SourceFile`],
//! and the mapping is ultimately backed by a [`SourceTable`] stored in the db.
//!
//! Expansion of builtin percent prefixes are handled by [`resolve_path()`],
//! which relies on [`expand_path`](toc_paths::expand_path) to do most of the
//! work. Path normalization is also performed before getting the final
//! interned path.
//!
//! The foundational trait is [`VfsBridge`], which bridges from the database's
//! internal representation of the filesystem to the real underlying filesystem.
//! It's implemented on the real top level database, and handles converting
//! source files on disk into the UTF-8 format, as well as actual path
//! normalization.
//!
//! For more details on the specific bridging between the real and virtual
//! filesystem representations, see the VFS Interface in the top-level notes
//! directory.
