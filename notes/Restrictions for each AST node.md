# Restrictions for each AST node

We don't care about checking semantic things like type correctness or correct number of parameters, as AST validation
only aims to restrict the parse tree to be in line with the original grammatical restrictions.
Nevertheless, semantic restrictions are still specified so that this serves as a unified reference for all
node restrictions.

## Definitions

- Top-level block: The main block, or any module-kind block (includes class, monitor, and module blocks)
- Program level: The main block
- module-like block: Blocks that are similar to modules (includes class, monitor, and module blocks)

## Nodes
